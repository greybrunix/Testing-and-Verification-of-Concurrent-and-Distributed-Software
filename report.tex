\section{Introduction}

This study purpose is to implement (a simple but representative) distributive algorithm in the Harmony language,
in which it's possible to visualize and simulate graphically the behaviour of a given network,
(measuring the necessary effort, the resulting code complexity and the verification hability).
% Something to add to the introduction
Simplify and standardize the creation process of distributive programs thorough the implementation of a library.

\section{Introduction to Harmony}

The Harmony programming language is a python-like language that model-checks concurrent and
distributive programs in order to explore each possible case for it to test and experiment these programs.

Harmony programs are tested through the terminal, in which you can choose whether to use the graphical user
interface (GUI) provided by Harmony or not. If the choice was not to use the GUI, then Harmony will produce
an html page that will show the error and a step by step throughout the program where it is visible the
changes in the stack and the various threads that the program executes. If the program doesn't contain
any errors, that page will show the finite automaton resulting from the program, in which each transition
is a print and each state is the in-between the different prints.
% explain better last part

While running the Harmony command, it will generate several files. If a program being tested is named ``x.hny'',
then the files that have been created will be named: ``x.hvm'', ``x.hco'' and ``x.htm'':
\begin{itemize}
    \item The ``x.hvm'' file is a JSON file that contains the bytecode that the Harmony compiler returned
	    from the original ``x.hny'' file. This is the file that is passed to the model checker.
    \item The ``x.hco'' file is also a JSON file that represents the shortest path,
	    through a graph, in order to pass it down to be translated by hamony.py, however, this
		will only be the case if there is a problematic path. If there isn't one, then
		this file will contain a simple phrase that states that there weren't any issues.
    \item The ``x.htm'' file is a HTML file. If there was a problem, it allows ot navigate through the path and
	    all the details of each of the states previously mentioned.
\end{itemize}

The model checker, which name is \textit{Charm}, explores the entire state space of the ``x.hvm'' file in breadth-first order.
%Quase copy e paste do livro, ter atenção a isto pls
\textit{Charm} stops when it finds a failing execution or when it has explored the entire state space,
depending on which happens first. An execution can produce an error for five reasons:
\begin{itemize}
    \item An invariant failing: the model checker verifies that all invariants in all states that it
	    finds are true, if one happens to be false, then Harmony stops further exploration.
    \item An assertion failling.
    \item A behaviour violation: this error is only when it's used a specific flag (-B flag)
	    and it means that the sequence of printed values are not recognized by the provided deterministic
		finite automaton (DFA).
    \item A silly error: it's basically errors that can occur do to syntax mistakes, like, for example,
	    reading variables that have not been assigned.
    \item An infinite loop: this happens when a thread begins an infinite cycle whithout accessing shared variables.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Sample Heading (Third Level)} Only two levels of
headings should be numbered. Lower level headings remain unnumbered;
they are formatted as run-in headings.

\paragraph{Sample Heading (Fourth Level)}
The contribution should contain no more than four levels of
headings. Table~\ref{tab1} gives a summary of all heading levels.

\begin{table}
\caption{Table captions should be placed above the
tables.}\label{tab1}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Heading level &  Example & Font size and style\\
\hline
Title (centered) &  {\Large\bfseries Lecture Notes} & 14 point, bold\\
1st-level heading &  {\large\bfseries 1 Introduction} & 12 point, bold\\
2nd-level heading & {\bfseries 2.1 Printing Area} & 10 point, bold\\
3rd-level heading & {\bfseries Run-in Heading in Bold.} Text follows & 10 point, bold\\
4th-level heading & {\itshape Lowest Level Heading.} Text follows & 10 point, italic\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\noindent Displayed equations are centered and set on a separate
line.
\begin{equation}
x + y = z
\end{equation}
Please try to avoid rasterized images for line-art diagrams and
schemas. Whenever possible, use vector graphics instead (see
Fig.~\ref{fig1}).

\caption{A figure caption is always placed below the illustration.
Please note that short captions are centered, while long ones are
justified by the macro package automatically.} \label{fig1}
\end{figure}

\begin{theorem}
This is a sample theorem. The run-in heading is set in bold, while
the following text appears in italics. Definitions, lemmas,
propositions, and corollaries are styled the same way.
\end{theorem}
%
% the environments 'definition', 'lemma', 'proposition', 'corollary',
% 'remark', and 'example' are defined in the LLNCS documentclass as well.

\begin{proof}
Proofs, examples, and remarks have the initial word in italics,
while the following text appears in normal font.
\end{proof}
For citations of references, we prefer the use of square brackets
and consecutive numbers. Citations using labels or the author/year
convention are also acceptable. The following bibliography provides
a sample reference list with entries for journal
articles~\cite{ref_article1}, an LNCS chapter~\cite{ref_lncs1}, a
book~\cite{ref_book1}, proceedings without editors~\cite{ref_proc1},
and a homepage~\cite{ref_url1}. Multiple citations are grouped
\cite{ref_article1,ref_lncs1,ref_book1},
\cite{ref_article1,ref_book1,ref_proc1,ref_url1}.

\begin{credits}
\subsubsection{\ackname} A bold run-in heading in small font size at the end of the paper is
used for general acknowledgments, for example: This study was funded
by X (grant number Y).

\subsubsection{\discintname}
It is now necessary to declare any competing interests or to specifically
state that the authors have no competing interests. Please place the
statement with a bold run-in heading in small font size beneath the
(optional) acknowledgments\footnote{If EquinOCS, our proceedings submission
system, is used, then the disclaimer can be provided directly in the system.},
for example: The authors have no competing interests to declare that are
relevant to the content of this article. Or: Author A has received research
grants from Company W. Author B has received a speaker honorarium from
Company X and owns stock in Company Y. Author C is a member of committee Z.
