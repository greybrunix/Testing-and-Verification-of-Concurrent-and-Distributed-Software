* Phase 1: compile Harmony program to bytecode
* Phase 2: run the model checker (nworkers = 8)
pinning cores
    * 118 states (time 0.00s, mem=0.000GB)
    * 99/299 computations/edges
* Phase 3: analysis
        * 39 components (0.00 seconds)
    * Check for data races
    * **No issues found**
* Phase 4: write results to pt.hco
